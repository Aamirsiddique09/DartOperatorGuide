# Operators_in_Dart
 Operators in Dart perform arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operations. They are essential for calculations, value assignment, comparisons, and program flow control

Operators in Dart Language
Welcome to the Operators in Dart Language readme file. This document provides a brief overview of the operators available in the Dart programming language. Operators are essential tools for performing various operations, calculations, and comparisons in your Dart programs.

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations. The following arithmetic operators are available in Dart:

Addition (+): Adds two operands together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.
Modulo (%): Returns the remainder of the division operation.
Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They combine an operation with assignment. Dart provides the following assignment operators:

Assignment (=): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
Addition assignment (+=): Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
Subtraction assignment (-=): Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
Multiplication assignment (*=): Multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
Division assignment (/=): Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
Modulo assignment (%=): Calculates the modulo of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values and determine their relationship. Dart provides the following comparison operators:

Equal to (==): Checks if two operands are equal.
Not equal to (!=): Checks if two operands are not equal.
Less than (<): Checks if the first operand is less than the second.
Greater than (>): Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.
Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.
Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine and manipulate boolean values. Dart provides the following logical operators:

Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
Logical NOT (!): Negates the boolean value of the operand.
Feel free to explore and utilize these operators to perform calculations, assign values, make comparisons, and control the flow of your Dart programs.

Compatibility
The operators described in this readme are compatible with the Dart programming language. They can be used in various Dart environments and frameworks.

Feedback
If you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Dart community or refer to the official Dart documentation for more detailed information.

Thank you for using Dart and enjoy coding with operators
