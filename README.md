## Arithmetic Operators

Dart provides various arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. This section demonstrates how to use these operators and provides practical examples.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators in Dart allow you to compare values and determine relationships, such as equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc. Learn how to use these operators and explore common usage scenarios.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators, including AND, OR, and NOT, enable you to combine conditions and perform logical operations in Dart. This section covers their usage and provides examples to clarify their functionality.

## Assignment Operators

Dart provides shorthand assignment operators that combine arithmetic or logical operations with variable assignment. Understand how to leverage these operators for concise and efficient code.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators in Dart operate on individual bits of integer values. This section explains bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and shift operators, along with practical examples showcasing their usage.

## Operator Overloading

Dart supports operator overloading, allowing you to define custom behavior for operators in your classes. Learn how to overload operators and create expressive and intuitive custom types.

## Operator Precedence

Understanding the precedence of operators is essential to write correct and unambiguous expressions in Dart. This section provides a comprehensive overview of operator precedence rules.

## Examples

The "examples" directory contains a collection of code snippets that demonstrate the usage of different operators in various scenarios. Feel free to explore the examples, modify the code, and experiment with Dart operators.
